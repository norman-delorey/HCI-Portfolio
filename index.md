## Welcome to my Human Computer Interaction Portfolio
Hello! My name is Norman Delorey, and I am a member of the WPI class of 2020 studying computer science. Over the course of this term,
I have worked on six different projects in small groups. These projects tackle different aspects of human computer interaction and the
user experience, and I am happy with all that I have learned this term. You can learn more about the design process that I have 
learned [here](https://medium.com/@ndelorey11/my-design-manifesto-8f5a52d3e879).
